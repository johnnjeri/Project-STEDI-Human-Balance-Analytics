# Project-STEDI-Human-Balance-Analytics
The files above entail a data engineering project by the name "STEDI: Human Balance Analytics" by Udacity. 

The project involves creatign glue jobs to construct a collective data pipeline for a company that has been hard at work developing 
a hardware STEDI Step Trainer that:

-trains the user to do a STEDI balance exercise;
-and has sensors on the device that collect data to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect steps;
-has a companion mobile app that collects customer data and interacts with the device sensors.

## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, 
and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.
